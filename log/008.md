# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 8: January 16, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
Continued on the sophomore track today and it was so much fun! Deployed a series of sites on vercel that interact with the blockchain - feel free to join the fun below!

#### Solidity
Spent a considerable amount of time going over basic solidity syntax but also learning about `providers`, `signers`, `BigNumbers`, `ABI` and the `ERC20 Approval Flow`.

These are key concepts to understand when building smart contracts and also trying to interact with them via JavaScript libraries like `ethers` or `web3` for example that need the ABI metadata to work.

The deep dive on `allowance` and how it works in Smart Contracts was very good to know! It's an initial action that each wallet must take with a smart contract before they can do any kind of `transfer` from or to of the token in that contract.

#### 1‚É£ The `Crypto Devs` Whitelist dApp
Get whitelisted where first 10 are free for a `Crypto Dev` NFT!

 - **Contract:** 0x86999411C206B28637959Df2aca9db4531Bb0615
 - **Network:** Ethereum Goerli Testnet
 - [**Etherscan**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x86999411C206B28637959Df2aca9db4531Bb0615)

#### 2‚É£ The `Crypto Devs` NFT Collection
This project from LearnWeb3DAO introduced me to the `Ownable.sol` contract from `Openzeppelin` which helps manage the `Ownership` of a contract. Notably you can:
 - `transferOwnership` to a new owner from the current owner
 - `renounceOwnership` which is a notable **best practice** where the current owner will **relinquish administrative privilege** 

Only 20 in the collection! Minting live!

#### 3‚É£ The ICO Has Arrived
Now we get to reward the lucky NFT holders! That's just me for now.

**Details:**

max of `10,000 CD` tokens
`Crypto Dev` NFT holders get `10 CD` tokens (gas not included)
`1 CD` = `0.001 ETH` at time of ICO (goerli testnet)

#### 4‚É£ Introducting the `Crypto Devs DAO`!

**Details:**

Anyone with a `CryptoDevs` NFT can create a proposal to purchase a fake NFT from a fake NFT marketplace

Everyone with a `CryptoDevs` NFT can vote `YAY` or `NAY` on active proposals

Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal

Voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT

If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed

5 minutes to vote for each proposal

#### AMM and DeX
Had a great deep dive into the smart contract functional requirements for an automated market maker - what the differences are to a traditional AMM. The math was also really fun to review and learn how liquidity pools can be managed in a DeX  and how slippage is calculated depending on the core formula used for the AMM.

Got to read about how the intiial price of a coin is affected by the arbitrary ratio of liquidity provided and controlled to only allow this to occur when the liquidity is empty for example - that way it will maintain a ratio with market prices and difficult to manipulate.

Supply limits vs infinite supply are also influential in determining the viability of LP-tokens themselves which act as shares when a user provides liquidity. It matters if a LP token is minted when liquidity is added or comes from a circulating supply with a limit.

#### Avalanche
[Prepared a Ledger Live to use with Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-mainnet-subnet#setting-up-your-ledger). This is needed to deploy [avalanche subnets](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) on mainnet and good to practice on testnet.

I then transfered some testnet AVAX and we're in business - almost, one day.

It worked!

### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**
The primer on the math behind the AMM for the DeX has really got my attention. Means I'm interested and would like to become more fluent in it! It was great to see how to logically process the formulas then apply them to solidity! I need resources for this - could start with studying existing DeX AMM like Uniswap and their documentation or other protocols I'm interested in.

### **üóíÔ∏è Side-note**
I'll be building the DeX tomorrow or might get started tonight we'll see...
