# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 36: February 13, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Git Again**

Played with Git some more today. Master your tools. I was playing around with `merge`, `rebase` and `cherry-pick` to get the feel for it and nagivating a git tree.

Already have `git log` modified to do what I like:

```sh
git () {
  if [[ "${@}" == "log" ]]
  then
    command git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  else
    command git "${@}"
  fi
}
```

So now branches and commits are easier to visualize 🤣

### **Canto Node**

Made it into the final leg of the race today and made it to the block height for current version 5.0.0!

This is exciting and places the node currently at... **92.6%**

```sh
% echo "$(curl -ks "https://localhost:26657/status?" | jq -r '.result.sync_info.latest_block_height') / $(curl -ks "https://rpc.canto.silentvalidator.com/status?" | jq -r '.result.sync_info.latest_block_height') * 100" | bc -l
92.66
```

This is going to be a huge milestone for my progress to date.

I will then have deployed some more meaningful web3 infrastructure and then onto designing projects for the next layers: **smart contract**, **front end**, **dao's**, etc.

### **Blog Coming Soon**

`***`

So I've decided how to generate my blog(s) and that I don't have to centralize my social feeds anymore with web3.

In the next day or two, the first blog post will showcase setting up a vanilla linux machine. It's an important starting point in any developer's toolkit.

Then we'll progress with other topics like nodes, validators, smart contract devopment, web development as it all relates to web3!
