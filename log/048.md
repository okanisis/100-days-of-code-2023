# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 48: February 25, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

### **Canto Node**

With the setback from the corrupted database I took the time today to enhance the network and apply additional configurations to the machines for security and performance updates.

### **StackUp**

OK... not sure what to say here. Got another rejected quest and sure I'm going to get a bunch more failed.

It's a lot of work to go through some of these quests. I don't care if they're paid or not. I'm selective with them and only do ones that pertain to my goals and interests.

I do not want to look forward to the dissappointment anymore and maybe should look towards other priorities.
