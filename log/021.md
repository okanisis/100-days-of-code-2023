### **🥵 Today's Progress**

# [🛠️](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/pull/80)

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
☝️ my first pull request to a web3 project. It at least works, and we'll see if I can get a full archive node out of it. Next error here I come! I'm sure it's not perfect cause I don't really know much about what I did but it's working!

Looking forward to learning as much as I can from this experience and it's inspiring.
