# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 22: January 31, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

### **Exercism**

I started today with [**Exercism**](https://exercism.org/). A platform new to me that has an amazing layout and delivery for their coding tracks that I started right away with JavaScript.

This is just the primer I needed and it was good to take a step back from some other things I've been going hard on for the past week or so.

I'm working towards starting some web3 development but there's a few little details I want to get out of JavaScript before I move on to TypeScript or Solidity and also keep on with front end with React and other frameworks.

[**Exercism has a command line utility**](https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough) that helps you conduct the courses from the command line.

Just using this tool today I learned some really neat things. Like:

- [**how to setup workspaces in npm to share a single node_module directory for multiple projects**](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces) which is going to save so much storage!
- [**enhanced markdown editing with vscode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)

The **npm workspaces**  was so useful! I'd be going into each exercise directory and running `npm install` to create a folder of dependencies for just that lesson. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. These **node_module** folders are no joke - they bloat like no other. So workspaces provided a solution to that.

This was awesome cause doing the courses from the command line is really fun! Like look at the output from the test!

```sh
exercism/javascript % npm run test --workspace=hello-world

> test
> jest ./*

 PASS  ./hello-world.spec.js
  Hello World
    ✓ Say Hi! (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.379 s, estimated 2 s
Ran all test suites
```

Then you can submit the results to the site with `exercism submit hello-world/hello-world.js`  and that's it!

The folders you get from each lesson have a `.md` or markdown files to help you navigate the material and develop a solution.

It's so easy to open the folder in vscode and then preview all those markdown files for easy visibility plus the terminal built in makes doing these course all in one place so so so so so so convenient.

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**

Study hard young **duhveluper** and get ready for both **Ethereum Bootcamp** and **Road to Web3**.
