# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 43: February 20, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

### **DeveloperDAO Mentee**

Today was the day! I got prepped over the weekend and made my intro and pitch at **Developer_DAO Season 2 Mentorship.**

I've applied as a **mentee** and pitched a **MVP**.

I have a core tech that I believe is going to be scalable to serve a number of purposes.

Can't spill the beans just yet as it's obviously early in the works, but the roadmap is promising and I am excited to see what potential it has!

### **Canto Node**

Hit a small roadbump on the node...

It got close to the tip on one of the machine and decided to bork out! WTH.

So much work and time, 24/7 monitoring and waiting for this thing to sync. The effory put into getting a damn genesis build... Took almost a week by itself.

I'm not gonna lose hope though and will persevere.

I just don't like being behind schedule for anything.

### **LearnWeb3 Senior**

Continued the Senior Track at LearnWeb3.io and it went over Ethereum Nodes. Specifically how they store data and execute smart contracts.

The premise of this track is to introduce me to security and identify commonly known vulnerabilities and learn the why and how to exploit them.
