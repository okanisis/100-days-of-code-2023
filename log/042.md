# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 42: February 20, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Merkle Trees**

Started the final Senior Track at LearnWeb3.io

It starts with an introduction to merkle trees and dag. I've never spent too much time reading about the intricacies of the concept but it's really interesting and will be spending more time reading about it in the coming weeks!

***

### **Radicle**

Setup some Radicle nodes on my LAN to make my code more redundant and it's been really fun!

Radicle is basically Github on the blockchain.

***

### **Canto Node**

I setup the validator node today, and began setting up the sentries. Going live very soon!
