# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 24: February 01, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

To kick things off, it was **DeveloperDAO** Season 2 start! Big changes to Discord and overall DAO structure and governance. Looks exciting!

Today it was back to basics and and a lot of review.

I attended **Web3SecurityDAO** Genesis Group Study and it as a reminder i need to hit the books to understand things at a deeper level.

We're working through **Secureum** and it's a lot of fun. The questions asked we're super interesting and each one taught me something new.

This is why I went back to basics. There's always something new to learn and I spent most of the afternoon playing around and reading about [**Expressions and Operators**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) with a focus on the [**Arithmetic Operators**](https://javascript.info/operators)

The section on `commas` really stood out to me cause I've seen them lots but never took full grasp of them until deep studying precedence and the order of operators.

And things like this become possible with a `,`:

```js
// three operations in one line
for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) {
 ...
}
```
