### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### [Canto.io](https://canto.io)
I've got my eye on you [**Canto.io**](https://canto.io/), in fact so much so that I've built the latest release for [**cantod node**](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto) on Arch Linux which is **5.0.0** at the time of writing.

[**Today was update day too**](https://canto.mirror.xyz/HvJHkX-2eDqHwdDlskCDnp7cpKtk_u-xgvCgj1FzG6E) so perfect timing! I've even got an upgraded systemd.service file for them to use which should greatly secure above the defaults they have which include running as **root** and using **/root/** as working directory (...wtf)

Anywho - I have plans. Big plans. I'm prepping to be a validator on **Canto**

**Canto Network** uses **Cosmos SDK**, the **IBC Protocol** and runs  [**Tendermint**](https://tendermint.com/) [(*now **Ignite***)](https://ignite.com/) nodes - why is this important!? Because I now have a basic knowledge of default locations and config files!

I found the following [**default config locations for ibc protocol nodes using tendermint here**](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/64747b2b184184ecba4f4bffc54ffbcb47cfbcb0/config/config.go#L33):
```js
// NOTE: Most of the structs & relevant comments + the
// default configuration options were used to manually
// generate the config.toml. Please reflect any changes
// made here in the defaultConfigTemplate constant in
// config/toml.go
// NOTE: libs/cli must know to look in the config dir!
var (
	DefaultTendermintDir = ".tendermint"
	defaultConfigDir     = "config"
	defaultDataDir       = "data"

	defaultConfigFileName  = "config.toml"
	defaultGenesisJSONName = "genesis.json"

	defaultPrivValKeyName   = "priv_validator_key.json"
	defaultPrivValStateName = "priv_validator_state.json"

	defaultNodeKeyName  = "node_key.json"
	defaultAddrBookName = "addrbook.json"

	defaultConfigFilePath   = filepath.Join(defaultConfigDir, defaultConfigFileName)
	defaultGenesisJSONPath  = filepath.Join(defaultConfigDir, defaultGenesisJSONName)
	defaultPrivValKeyPath   = filepath.Join(defaultConfigDir, defaultPrivValKeyName)
	defaultPrivValStatePath = filepath.Join(defaultDataDir, defaultPrivValStateName)

	defaultNodeKeyPath  = filepath.Join(defaultConfigDir, defaultNodeKeyName)
	defaultAddrBookPath = filepath.Join(defaultConfigDir, defaultAddrBookName)

	minSubscriptionBufferSize     = 100
	defaultSubscriptionBufferSize = 200
)
```

So basically (maybe not so basic) is I've got a secure node to fire up and with default configs. This makes it easy for others to fire up a node quickly and from there change the defaults to their liking. It starts in `{fast,state}sync` mode to quickly get to speed and start working. Changes to config needed to make it archive node and other things of course, but out of the box it works wonderfully.

I also wanted to initiate my node with a ledger for the private key but it was having trouble reading the Ledger. I need to look into this more but during my reasearch discovered some best practices for private key management.

I gotta separate the services. Another computer is going to run the [**Tendermint Key Management System**](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms) or **tmkms**. This is now on the to do list to build a package for it!

Lastly I need to do is consider detailed technical setup info for redundancy, security and other usage needs. [**Running a tendermint node in production**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html) is a great guide to get started and learn how to design! I'm so close to being a validator on **Canto!**

As a validator on **Canto** there are some other considerations such as network layout and two ways are **remote sentries:**:

And **local sentries:**
![](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/assets/img/local_config.0b47aff9.png "tendermint node with local sentries")

The docs have starting docs for both [**validator node configuration**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#validator-node-configuration) and [**Sentry node configuration**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#sentry-node-configuration).

#### IPFS
**Kubo** the command line utility for running an **IPFS** gateway and stuff had an upgrade.

This required an [**upgrade on the repo**](https://github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations/blob/master/run.md) itself as well which involved grabbing the latest upgrade utility [**`fs-repo-migrations `**](https://dist.ipfs.tech/#fs-repo-migrations). IPFS was failing to start because of outdated repo **v2**, and now requiring **v3**. The upgrade was really straight forward and the IPFS local gateway fired up again!

But something was different, **IPFS** seemed.. nicer... It wasn't hogging resources, forking out a million connections. The `ResourceMngr` was actually working but too well. I need to spend some time tweaking it now to get it more performant again.

### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**
I've gotta get [**all the IPFS packages**](https://dist.ipfs.tech/#about) together in a group for **Arch Linux** - I know exactly how to do this and it's going to be marvelous! Stay tuned!

Time to fire up a validator node, a sentry node and tmkms server for my validator node configuration. This is gonna be fun exciting. Here we go!
