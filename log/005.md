# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 5: January 13, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
There was a slight change of plans today. I intended to work on the second track at learnweb3.io but instead tackled my avalanche node! Why did it need some work? Cause the dang thing was gonna take 10000hrs to sync a full archived node.

I hit up [Avalanche Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org) and got some help with the recommendation being consider your specs! I might need faster storage for example, as I got an old 2TB HDD syncing the archive node at the moment but then have a laptop running another node that will make a `state sync` node which is essentially a node without the history in it. Not ideal but good enough to get an active node so issue RPC calls against!

At this point, I have two laptops sync'ing avalanche mainnet:
 - one an archive node (sync while i use the sync state node)
 - one a sync state node (for immediate use)

These laptops have prometheus, grafana and postman. Grafana lets me visual the node metrics with, you guessed it, graphs and Postman has templates to interact with an avalanche node - this makes issuing RPC calls a breeze.

I was donated an old gaming tower that I can retrofit (after A LOT of tlc) with a SSD once I get my hands on one - 4TB would be ideal.

I also [applied to portrait.gg](https://beta.portrait.gg/join) [on twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRealOkanisis/status/1614042757018046465?s=20&t=6xwo5ChQ1nxVhWSOpOo5sA) where it's a on-chain hosting solution which I want to explore and likely try deploying my projects on it (front-ends).

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
**To-Do:**
 - get back to smart contract coding tomorrow with LearnWeb3.io!
 - fire up an ursa node for fleek.xyz
 - setup a reverse proxy using NGINX for nodes and any WAN facing services I deploy in the future

### **🗒️ Side-note**
Invest in some SSD to insert into your new/old tower that was donated!

My pile of junk might not cut it:
