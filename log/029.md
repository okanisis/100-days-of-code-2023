### **ü•µ Today's Progress**

#### **Operators & Precedence**

***

Exercism has a *beginner* JavaScript exercise on boolean operators that has stumped me.

It required a dive into [**operator precedence**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#) and specifically [**binary operators.**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#binary_logical_operators)

I spent the past day or two simply reviewing basics heavily hoping for a segway into this topic and after messing around with hello-world this, hello-world that I think I finally understand.

It's similar to arithmetic order of operations type stuff and if you understand things like BEDMAS, how JavaScript does it isn't too far off with a few key gotchas that I try to capture below.

In fact, the rules are quite clear on how it's going to interpret [**operators based on their precedence.**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table)

#### **Precedence and Associativity Basics**

***

Operators have precedence, and it means that those with higher precedence will be evaluated first.

Then it will also consider the *associativity* which will be either *left-to-right* or *right-to-left*. This is the direction the interpretation goes.

For example:

- `=` is the `assignment operator` that has a `right-to-left` associativity and very low precedence.
- `()` is the `grouping operator` that has a very high precedence.

Refer to [**this table for a complete list of javascript operators with their precedence and associativity.**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table)

#### **A Few Rules**

***

The following is borrowed heavily from [**the JavaScript MDNS doc on Operator Precedence**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence). Highly recommend reviewing in detail!

Let's have a look at the [**arithmetic operators**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#arithmetic_operators):

!["javascript arithmetic operators"](https://i.imgur.com/x6O17DW.png)

Operators with higher precedence go first and associativity doesn't apply but grouping can change the order:

```js
a = 1 + 2 * 3   // 7
a = 1 + (2 * 3)  // 7, same as above
a = (1 + 2) * 3 // 9
```

Operators with the same precedence are grouped based on their associativity either *left-to-right* or *right-to-left*:

```js
// right associative example
a = b = 3;       // a = (b = 3);
a = 4 ** 3 ** 2; // 4 ** (3 ** 2)

// left associative example
b = 4 / 3 / 2;   // (4 / 3) / 2
```

A prefix [**unary operator**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#unary_operators) is grouped first when it has higher precedence than it's accompanying binary operator otherwise it's grouped by the binary operator:

```js
const a = 1;  // equivalent to const (a = 1)
const b = 2;  // equivalent to const (b = 2)
typeof a + b; // equivalent to (typeof a) + b; "number2"
```

#### **An Example: Puting It All Together**

***

What's really different about the order of operations and precedence in the following example is how grouping is applied to group 4! It's not the same as BEDMAS and follows one of the rules from above: can you highlight which one?

From the MDNS docs:

>Operator precedence will be handled recursively. For example, consider this expression:
>
>```plaintext
>1 + 2 ** 3 * 4 / 5 >> 6
>```
>
>First, we group operators with different precedence by decreasing levels of precedence.
>
>1. The `**` operator has the highest precedence, so it's grouped first.
>2. Looking around the `**` expression, it has `*` on the right and `+` on the left.
>    1. `*` has higher precedence, so it's grouped first.
>    2. `*` and `/` have the same precedence, so we group them together for now.
>3. Looking around the `*`/`/` expression grouped in 2, because `+` has higher precedence than `>>`, the former is grouped.
>
>```plaintext
>    (1 + ( (2 ** 3) * 4 / 5) ) >> 6
>// ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 1. ‚îÄ‚îò        ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
>// ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò ‚îÇ
>// ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 3. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
>```
>
>4. Within the `*`/`/` group, because they are both *left-associative*, the left operand would be grouped.
>
>```plaintext
>    (1 + ( ( (2 ** 3) * 4 ) / 5) ) >> 6
>// ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 1. ‚îÄ‚îò     ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
>// ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò ‚îÇ
>// ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 3. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
>//        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 4. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
>```
>
>Note that operator precedence and associativity only affect the order of evaluation of operators (the implicit grouping), but not the order of evaluation of operands. The operands are always evaluated from left-to-right. The higher-precedence expressions are always evaluated first, and their results are then composed according to the order of operator precedence.
