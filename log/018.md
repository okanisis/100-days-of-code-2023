# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 18: January 26, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
#### Canto Validation
I've got an idea of what's needed to [run a Canto.io Validator in Production Mode.](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html).

At this stage, I have a node running and tested it with both [state_sync]() and [snapshot](https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/canto).

Next I need to setup 2 or more sentry nodes as my vanguard with a separate server running Tendermint KMS.

I can get most of that done tomorrow and over the weekend as I've got some investments to make in some hardware for this setup.

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**

### **🗒️ Side-note**
There we're two governance proposals today for Canto.io and the first was to [enable CSR while increasing gas fees](https://canto.io/governance/proposal/43). The [gas fee increase was reverted in the following proposal](https://canto.io/governance/proposal/44) as it introduced unanticipated changes - and would you guess it, to the gas fees!
