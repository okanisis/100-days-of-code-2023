# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 3: January 11, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
Continued with JavaScript basics from Alchemy University and completed Chapter 1!!! Yes! BUT... these new advanced topics are really just that - advanced and I need to take some time to consider some other intro courses for specific topics I'm having trouble grasping, utilize discord for support and other means.

I moved into Chapter 2 which is **Array Manipulation** and actually having a lot of fun. It's nice to apply previous learnings to the challenges at the end of each lesson.

Arrays have a lot of built in functions to help: `.sort()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` notably. The logic was fairly straight forward, though I am having trouble applying `constructor()` efficiently and wanna master these with `prototypes`.

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
I think I gotta find some other beginner friendly tutorials for JavaScript - which I've listed below in Links. Alchemy University starts off nice, then it throws you in head first! I spend more time researching and teaching myself than I do reading their lesson plans. I feel at the later stages, they provide keywords and not enough instruction. I take those keywords and hit up ChatGPT (for some very interesting conversations), stackoverflow and google.

I've never worked this in-depth with JavaScript as in the past it's been a lot of click-ready-deploy type JavaScript sites that used leaflet, openlayers and other webmapping libraries. My new knowledge in JavaScript is actually making a lot of that code more readable than ever!

I'm afraid of [chimp-syndrome](https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm) though as I follow google-structions and will be wary of it. ChatGPT can be really off-base as well but that's a bonus as it helps me catch mistakes and is a great positive reinforcement learning mechanism!

### **🗒️ Side-note**
[avalanchego v1.9.6 released!](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.9.6) - I've got my eye on Avalanche 🔺! Will be spinning up [an avalanche node tomorrow](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/run-avalanche-node-manually)!
