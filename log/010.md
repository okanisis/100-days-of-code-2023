# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 10: January 18, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### Crypto Package Building on Archlinux
I couldn't find any "true" `radicle-cli` or `radicle-client-services` packages on Archlinux. There are a few in the AUR but they are shipments of the binaries.

I wanted to compile from source and these packages use `cargo` from `go` which is `rust`. I have my own Storj bucket to upload packages to, mapped to a CDN and available for anyone!

I normally used this for building Geographic Information Systems packages but am now filling the repository with web3 and crypto related packages. These two are my first!

REPO Details coming soon for Archlinux users!

#### Networking and Growth
I attended the Alchemy University Townhall today and got lots of great information!

Like why the POC program was suspended currently due to spam and abuse (re-selling of wallets that had POCs) so a new program is being rolled out. This will be great to have to showcase your knowledge and dedication to the program and graduation.

They also share a lot of info on future ways to network and grow your skills in the real world and I've summarized some links in the `links` section below.

#### Radicle.xyz (github decentralized alternative)
I spent A LOT of gas yesterday because of a [dang visual bug at app.radicle.xyz](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-interface/issues/584) and it was causing me a big headache.

And what's really cool about the commit that fixed it is, well.. it's JavaScript! And man, I could of fixed this myself after [reading the commit and seeing the fix](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-interface/commit/7eff5995c7417dce60a20bb215959d04bbdd908e), it actually all made sense and very simple too!

First I registered an ens with them (gas!) set it to my public address (gas!) and updated the profile (gas!) when I didn't really need to or even have an ENS at all. It's convenience for resolving your URN which is like a radicle ID for you.

So in the end, ended up registering my ens `okanisis.eth` and setting it as my main reverse record cause the `.radicle.eth` ENS reset it when I registered and set that one.

I also got a Radicle ID as a URN now cause I compiled the `radicle-cli` packages from source!

```sh
% rad self
Profile 8fb32c7f-c30d-45e8-8545-ec67faa23499
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Name           okanisis.eth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ URN            rad:git:hnrkq9wm7biuumnkbrou1t76xtr48cbdjj61y
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Peer ID        hyn6ymmksxe5gcsyinh3w7my971x3ky6y1putjagcfz55gqjob1g8o
```

```sh
% rad auth
Your active profile is 8fb32c7f-c30d-45e8-8545-ec67faa23499

üå± Authenticating as rad:git:hnrkq9wm7biuumnkbrou1t76xtr48cbdjj61y (okanisis.eth)
```

And with that! I can now register it to my ENS at app.radicle.xyz - but this was always the first and most important step to getting onto the Radicle network and I'm in!

### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**
Maybe it's time to go minor bug hunting on some JavaScript front end projects or even ones that utilize JS to interact with blockchains and smart contracts and test my new skills!

Next I need to create a package for avalanchego fully integrated in archlinux.

### **üóíÔ∏è Side-note**
I gotta get that donated tower cleaned up and sync'd to avalanche!!! I keep forgetting but I'm always so busy.
