# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 4: January 12, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
Finished Alchemy University's: Data Structures > Array Manipulation. It was a really fun module and surpirsed that most of my solutions (which worked really well btw) were not similar to theirs but I checked what their answers were and my approaches were simply reducing lines of code into one.

With that out of the way, it was time to take a breather from coding! I want an avalanche node! I found an old 2TB harddrive in my pile and decided to put that into an old laptop that had an extra bay - perfect!

Deploying the node was very easy with [pre-built binaries for avalanchego](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases) and the [configuration of the avalanche node](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/run-avalanche-node-manually) was very straight forward - even have TLS to boot!

I also setup [monitoring with grafana and prometheus and using Postman as RPC and localhost:3000 as grafana front-end](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/setting-up-node-monitoring)!

Sync'ing as we speak and I'm building a full index'd node. Says to expect finish sync'ing in 6 days!

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
I think I'm going to tackle the second track in [learnweb3.io](https://learnweb3.io/) which is the Sophomore track and will take me through making a Uniswap like dApp! For tomorrow, going to start tonight!

### **🗒️ Side-note**
I have great ideas for my first project and have been fleshing it out. Will share more once I get to that point.
