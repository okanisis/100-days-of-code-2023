# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 35: February 12, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Git**

I spent way more time than I should of playing with the **git visualizer** at [**learngitbranching**](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

All day almost, going back and forth before I finally feel super comfortable with the basics of:

- `merge` vs `rebase`
- `reset` vs `revert`
- significance of `HEAD`
- proper `branch` management
- `cherry-pick`ing commits and `rebase -i`

I've used git forever, but got way too comfortable with specific workflows and adhering to a comfort zone. Mostly due to my lack of actual understanding.

Taking the time to practice and practice some more are really paying off.

Using Git to manage code, system settings/configs, user settings/profiles across networks seem so much more inviting with git and even tolerable. I used to be intimidated by changes and *breaking* things. But Git was made to handle that kind of stuff!

### **Circle API**

The 2/3 of for **Circle API Campaign** at **StackUp** was released tonight.

It was 3 action packed missions to finally pull up those sleeves and move some MOOLAS around with the Circle API.

We created and funded a master wallet. Setup a payout account and receiving wallet. Sent funds between the wallets using USD.

It started with generating a local front-end to initiate a tx which was fairly straight forward.

I will be leveraging the power of APIs, GraphQL and other REST/RPC tools to utilize multi-data sources in my apps and ideas.
