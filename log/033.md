# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 33: February 10, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **JavaScript Arrays and Conditionals**

I've gotten up to **Arrays and Conditionals** in the **JavaScript** track at **Exercism**, **LearnJavaScript.online** and **Alchemy University.**

As I'm going through each, I'm taking my time to **read the MDNS docs.**

The challenges are fun, and from yesterdays Journal: doing everything locally especially with Exercism CLI is a blast!

***

### **GraphQL with StackUp**

I haven't been giving StackUp the attention they deserve! I dropped the ball on their React campaign but redeemed myself with the new **GraphQL** campaign.

It's so cool! This **GraphQL** stuff is really powerful and coming from a SQL centric background it makes a lot of sense already.

I will be deep diving into this soon as I progress further past the basics!

***

### **APIs and Circle with StackUp**

So, regardless of the news with Circle in the news lately and the SEC: StackUp dropped a new campaign introducing me to the wonderful world of APIs.

There's a few primary different kinds and got a primer on their applications, limitations and capabilities.

This led me into the **Circle API** and an **Exchange Rate API.**

At this point, the campaign is about a 1/3 done and we've just been testing out simple API calls and how to structure them via **Postman.** but still learning the nuances of an API call.
