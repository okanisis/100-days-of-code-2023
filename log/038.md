# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 38: February 15, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **MEV Intro**

Got an excellent intro to MEV! It's maximum extractable value and in short it's the practice and ability of analyzing blocks primarily in the mempool to gain advantage of their order and even manipulate it.

Got the primer via layer3.xyz which prior to this past week or so felt like a gimmicky place to try and get you to stretch yourself thin with all their various "quests".

Recently the quests have taken a more educational turn and even provide testnet quests.

### **Canto Node Prep**

Spent more time today getting the machines all sync'd in terms of initial vanilla state and planning network diagram/schema.

It's important to take notes at this step to help with the planning. Essentially producing a summary of all my research.

94.8% done syncing and so close! Might just turn the validator on without a sync'd sentry but I can wait I guess...
