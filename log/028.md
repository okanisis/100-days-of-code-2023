#### **Exercism Basics**

Short one today, nothing big to share.

It's Sunday and I've been going hard for the past while. I took it easy and spent the morning tinkering with a few of the basic JavaScript exercises from Exercism.

Completed strings & numbers. Still need to do dang operators.

New week starts tomorrow and I'm ready!
