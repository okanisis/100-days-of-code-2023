### **Breaking Down `%` in JavaScript**

***

#### **The Problem**

***

I've always been curious how the modulo operator **`%`** works in various programming languages and why we always tested for `0` as some magic number.

I've used it (*and still do...*) quite a bit for displaying contours at specific intervals in the form of `elevation % interval`.

- *major* contours at **50m** intervals: **`elevation % 50`**
- *minor* contours at **5m** intervals: **`elevation % 5`**

And two ways were to `return true` if it's `result` was `0`.

So why does this test matter? **`if $(evelation % 50) === 0; return true;`**

#### **What ChatGPT Says**

***

**ChatGPT** provided an explanation of the proof behind the modulo operator **`%`** and this is what I got:

> The proof for the behavior of the modulo operator is based on the definition of division with remainder.
>
> Given two integers **`a`** and **`b`** where **`b != 0`**, there exist unique integers **`q`** (*quotient*) and **`r`** (*remainder*) such that **`a = b * q + r`** and **`0 <= r < |b|`**.
>
> The value of **`r`** is exactly what **`a % b`** returns in programming languages, including JavaScript.

I'd only add that **`|b|`** means absolute value - basically think of it as the non-negative value of whatever **`b`** is. So if **`b = -2`** then **`|b| = 2`**.

> For example, consider **`8 % 4`**.
>
> $8/4$ gives a **`q`** of **`2`** and a **`r`** of **`0`**, which means that **`8 = 4 * 2 + 0`**. Therefore, **`8 % 4`** evaluates to **`0`**.  
>
> Another example is **`7 % 2`**.
>
> $7/2$ gives a **`q`** of **`3`** and a **`r`** of **`1`**, which means that **`7 = 2 * 3 + 1`**. Therefore, **`7 % 2`** evaluates to **`1`**.

That means that if the **`remainder or r`** meet the criteria of **`0 <= r < |b|`** which it's saying **`r`** has to be **greater than or equal to 0 but also positive** then `true` else `false`.

#### **Making It Clear-er And Solving For `r`**

***

I think **ChatGPT** fails to explain how it evaluates `r`.

Because I thought $8/4 = 2$ so how is JavaScript and other programs that use the `%` operator output a `0`?

Remember this formula: **`a = b * q + r`**

We can derive **`q`** and **`r`** from:

- `q = Math.floor( a / b )`
- `r = a - ( q * b )`

For **`8 % 4`** you get **`r = 0`**:

```js
a = 8
b = 4

q = Math.floor( 8 / 4 ) // 2
console.log(q) // 2

// r = a - ( q * b )
r = 8 - ( 2 * 4 )
console.log(r) // 0

// a = b * q + r
// 8 = 4 * 2 + 0
```

In the case of **`7 % 2`** you get **`r = 1`**:

```js
a = 7
b = 2

q = Math.floor( 7 / 2 ) // 3.5
console.log(q) // 3

// r = a - ( q * b )
r = 7 - ( 3 * 3 )
r = 1

// a = b * q + r
// 7 = 3 * 2 + 1
```

It's to test for `0` because it shows that it is divisible without having a remainder - so anything other than `0` is not and therefor not included.
