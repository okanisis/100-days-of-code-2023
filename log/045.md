## 🗓️ Day 45: February 22, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

### **Radicle Knowledge Shrae**

Radicle Knowledge Share completed!

It was really fun and had a nice turnout with some great questions!

There was some last minute changes that I really didn't like especially about the part not being able to run our own node or the collaborative features not working and tracking.

Argh, at least there are big changes and good ones coming with Heartwood Release!

It was a bit of prep and worked a lot on getting it all together but was worth it.

Been so long since I held any kind of workshop/teaching.
