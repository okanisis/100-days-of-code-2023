# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 12: January 20, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### React with Stackup.dev
I entered the **React** campaign at Stackup.dev. I've done lots of react before with Learnweb3.io but this course was more of a deep dive into it and gained lots of valuable insights and skills!

On the way to being a Full-Stack Developer! I love front end UI/UX stuff and find it fascinating.

#### Non-EVM Chains with LearnWeb3.io

**Layer 1** vs **Layer 2** was covered yesterday on transaction exectution and data availability. Today is giving some specific examples.

**NEAR** Protocol used as an example to demonstrate a **sharding** network. Two words - hot potato.

**Flow** with it's four foundations:

- Multi-role architecture
    - Collection
    - Consensus
    - Execution
    - Verification
- Resource-oriented programming
  - see [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/cadence)
- Upgradeable smart contracts
  - developers can release smart contracts on chain in **beta** state and eventually release them to be non-fungible - users are aware of when a SC is in **beta**
- Easy on-ramps from fiat to crypto

**Avalanche**

mmmmm subnets... this is where my attention is for developing in the future!

**Solana**

üëé sorry, not a fan. centralized to the point that it can *go offline*... Who wants to *rent* an **account** to store their $SOL, and why need such extreme technical skills to build on solana.

#### ENS Tutorial with LearnWeb3.io
Just a simple app from LearnWeb3.io where you create a React/Next website that reads an ENS name from someone's wallet.

#### Radicle with LearnWeb3.io
It was great to get a detailed write up of Radicle.xyz, a platform and protocol (Radicle Link) that I am extremely interested in.

It's basically Github but decentralized via p2p.

For teams, it's recommended to [run your own radicle node](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-client-services) or can upload to one of the public shared ones like **willow.radicle.xyz** or **maple.radicle.xyz** for example.

Eventually the **radicle-cli** and **radicle-client-services** will be combined into project [**heartwood**](https://github.com/radicle-dev/heartwood) which is under active development.

#### Local Blockchain Node with LearnWeb3.io
This lesson I did something actually new (well did it once before.. but quickly) and it was to use **Hardhat** and deploy a local blockchain node.

These are great for deploying and testing smart contracts. Essentially you are a one-person shop, a dictator and are the consensus. No need to reach out to other validators and wait for a reply back. It's instant and you get to feel like a millionaire with almost 20 accounts filled with 10,000 ETH each. Think about that.

Then I went over how to deploy a smart contract on that local blockchain using both **npm hardhat** from terminal and **Metamask w/ Remix** via the browser.

#### Verifying Smart Contracts on Etherscan with LearnWeb3.io
I guess you want to verify your contracts on-chain because it will actually for one, expose the functions and allow it to be interacted with from various libraries and other means. It will also invite others to audit the contract, thus establishing trust.

Verifying contracts can be a tedious process as not just the main contract has to be verified - but **ALL** dependent/inheriting contracts. Any changes and verification happens again - this is very tedious and hardhat will make short work of that entire process.
### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**
I feel really confident about my gameplan; both project and learning wise. The resources out there are too good to just not capitalize on.

### **üóíÔ∏è Side-note**
Hey, you can [pin tweets to IPFS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pin-tweet-to-ipfs/bkbejdaeamaehgpodkjdbkhkofpijagn) - archive away! Especially if you know someone who likes to delete their tweets a lot! Make it permanent on IPFS.
