# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 19: January 28, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
### Validator Nodes
---
So I spent the entire day studying more about validator nodes and specifically Cosmos nodes that Canto.io runs.

It gave me a better understanding of the final requirements for a resilient validator setup! This validator is going to be online in a day or two.

### Rewards (it's what we came for)
---
Native staking rewards for **CANTO** are composed of:

>**Inflation on the Canto Network (Block Rewards):** The maximum supply of CANTO inflates over time at a rate that is constantly decreasing. Network security emissions will start around an inflation rate of 200M Canto per year for the first 30-day period, minting ~16m new CANTO tokens. Every subsequent period will face exponentially decaying security emissions. For subsequent periods, the Canto DAO will vote to adjust emissions as appropriate. All tokens from inflation are distributed to CANTO stakers, proportionally to their stake in the network. This implies that CANTO holders who choose not to stake will get diluted over time.

> In addition to this, Canto offers **liquidity mining rewards** of ~37 CANTO per block. While these rewards are not given to stakers, they make up a large portion of the inflation on the network. Medium-Term Liquidity Mining is expected to consist of six month-long epochs. The first epoch started at launch and distributed 5.83% of the token supply. The Canto DAO has onchain control over all liquidity mining schedules. As the first epoch concludes, the DAO may choose to pass a proposal to begin a second epoch.

> Long-Term Liquidity Mining is expected to continue liquidity mining after the Medium-Term Liquidity Mining allocation is emitted. The **Long-Term Liquidity Mining reserves may be emitted over the course of 10 years**, or any other schedule the DAO chooses.

> Please note that the total annual rewards are divided by all active stakers; hence, as the amount of staked tokens goes up, the reward rate goes down.

### Network
---
Basically start with the network stack. I need redundancy. I have a cable modem already.

If someone trips over ethernet cable, pulled out, it's damaged - well I then need to maybe consider a wireless module for the server that can act as a fallback interface if the wired network goes down.

That won't be enough cause what if that network goes down indefinitely? I could be [**JAILED, SLASHED or even TOMBSTONED**](https://docs.canto.io/technical-reference/validators/slashing).

With just those conditions in mind it now requires at a minimum a dual service provider or segregated lines coming in and I've got the option of having fiber optic installed which is a possibility. Starlink or other 5G module providers like Telus are good enough. Heck, even a phone with it's own SIM card sharing a mobile hotspot if you were desperate.

Regardless, with two lines running in, it would be worth it to invest in a network stack device that would automatically handle that for you. Could always be setup in linux but having a solid reliable device to control the traffic would be ideal. So this is something that will be included.

### Hardware
---
The [**Hardware Requirement for running a Canto Node**](https://docs.canto.io/technical-reference/validators/quickstart-guide#hardware-requirements) are more than doable.  

**Minimum**: 16GB RAM, 100GB NVME SSD, 3.2 GHz x 4 CPU  
**Recommended**: 32GB RAM, 500GB NVME SSD, 4.2 GHz x 6 CPU  
**Operating System**: Linux (x86_64 or amd64) e.g. Ubuntu or Arch Linux  

The biggest consideration besides network and latency, is storage. The big one being stay away from HDD as a SSD and an even faster nvme/m.2 drive is gonna be processing blocks a lot faster than you on a HDD.

Besides that, I've got everything I need computer wise besides the network controller but that can come later as there are other software based options that I will have to utilize till then.

### Validators and Sentries
---
The **Validator** will communicate only with the sentries as peers. No public communication.
The **Sentry(s)** will maintain a private un-advertised connection to the **Validator** while also maintaining p2p connectivity to the **Canto Network**.

**Configure/Install:**
 - [**Configuration for Nodes Initial Start**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#local-configuration)
 - [**Validators**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#validator-node-configuration)
 - [**Sentries**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#sentry-node-configuration)
 - [**Become/Install a Validator Node - Canto**](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto#becoming-a-validator)
 - [**Install Cosmovisor for Node Maintenance - Polkachu**](https://polkachu.com/installation/canto)

The **Validator's** gotta be quick, no rpc, no index, just [**bootstrap/snapshot**](https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/canto), or [**state sync**](https://polkachu.com/state_sync/canto) and off to the races. All attention needs to be on **validating**.

There's a lot of [**security considerations when setting up a validator on Canto**](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/security/security.html) and one big one is DDoS attacks that can take a validator offline or disrupt it's ability to capture and propose blocks. Worse case is you are taken offline.

This is where **Sentry Nodes** come into play and I talked about them before but are essential in helping the **Validator** by first taking the brunt of the attack and having a few other sentries to pick up the slack - but what if it's not a DDoS and you are actually experiencing a lot of traffic from lots of peers or txs, well sentries can load balance as well and make it easier network wise on the validator.

You can see a nice diagram for Validators and Sentries in [**day 18's**](017.md).

### Software
---
#### General
---
The Operating System of choice if of course no other than the mighty [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org).

It will give me full control over the entire server design.
 - encrypted disks and partitions
 - secure boot
 - user and group management
 - security policies via SELinux, AppArmor, etc
 - network security and resiliency (tcp/udp stack hardening, firewall, bridging or fallback interfaces)
 - LAN and WAN communications can further be enhanced by running all services on each machine locally, ie, via 127.0.0.1 but use secure shell **openssh** reverse local tunneling when needed or/and **VPN**
 - use of  **openssl** TLS certificates where needed and further hardening via reverse proxies via **nginx** or **apache**
 - [**monitoring**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html#monitoring-tendermint) with things like systemd timers and other features for service management and monitoring of node health via the local rpc endpoints or visualize metrics with [**prometheus** and **grafana**](https://github.com/cosmos/awesome-cosmos#monitoring)
 - system configs and maintenance via [**radicle.xyz**](https://radicle.xyz/) or [**git**](https://github.com/git/git) to keep all systems in sync.

Options are endless.

### Private Keys and Other
---
#### General Considerations
---
But now there is the ecosystem of software for running a secure validator node itself as it can be quite a task to manage nodes for forks, upgrades and all sorts of different scenarios.

First is the node package [**cantod**](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto) which I have compiled already and ready to go. It's uploaded to a private repository that can be accessed from all validators and sentries when updates happen.

#### Private Keys
---
From the [**Tendermint docs on private keys for validators**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/validators.html#validator-keys):
> Protecting a validator's consensus key is the most important factor to take in when designing your setup. The key that a validator is given upon creation of the node is called a consensus key, it has to be online at all times in order to vote on blocks. It is not recommended to merely hold your private key in the default json file (priv_validator_key.json).

Besides the above, it's also import to [**avoid being slashed by 5% and ultimately tombstoned(*jailed indefinitely*) by the canto gods for double-signing when running multiple validators for fallback/redundancy**](https://docs.canto.io/technical-reference/validators/slashing#consensus-fault-slashing).

Software wise, key management and signing can be automated with:
 - [**tmkms** (*simple*)](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms)
 - [**horcrux**](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux/blob/main/docs/migrating.md) [(*advanced: double-signing mitigation*](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.x/spec/consensus/signing.md#double-signing)
 
 Key Generation and Signing can be done with any form of [**Hardware Security Module HSM**](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/security/security.html#hardware-hsm) that utilizes [**ED25519**](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) encryption like:
  - [**yubikey HSM**](https://www.yubico.com/products/hardware-security-module/)
  - [**ledger**](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison)
  - [**advanced HSM solution**](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules).

#### Other
---
Tools for node management and upgrades include:
 - [**cosmovisor**](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/cosmovisor#readme)
 - [**Ignite CLI**](https://github.com/ignite/cli).

Auto Compounding of Stakers Rewards for Maximum APR Potential:
