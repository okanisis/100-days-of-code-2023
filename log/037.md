# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 1: February 01, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Canto Network Pre-Deploy Setup**

The archive node is very close to the tip: **94.13%**

One or two more days.

Taking the time now to setup the machines to a vanilla state to ensure everything is configured correctly and as efficiently as possible.

These are built for running nodes and will be configured as such.

The network setup consists of:

- x3 sentry nodes (full archives)
- x2 validator nodes (one is for high availability)

This can all be ran off consumer grade hardware. No real need to invest more than a decent tower with enough hard drives can really support this or any network really.

I'll be sharing the process of getting these vanilla machines setup soon!
