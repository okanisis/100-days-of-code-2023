# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 41: February 18, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Canto Node**

So everything is at a very good state

- all linux boxes are ready to go
- cantod packages built v1 - latest!
- entire archive node sync'd and transferring to sentries!

**Next steps:** configure the sentries and the validators and setup key management with horcrux (preferrably).

I expect to be live by tomorrows day end!

Have a great moniker selected too.

### **DeveloperDAO Season 2 Mentee**

I have been assigned a slot in the "western" timezone with the other mentees and given details on how the time will be spent speed dating my possible mentors.

I'm still extremely nervous but got a small number of projects that I think I can narrow down to the most viable candidate while having a few fallbacks.

They touch on very different subjects to allow me some flexibility and what I want to build or develop.

I hope my studying and work up to this point is up to snuff. If not, it's a gentle reminder to keep going and one day it will all happen!

### **JavaScript**

Had some more fun with **Exercism.io** learning how to filter and manipulate arrays. I'm really getting the hand of it and taking my time to examine the MDNS docs on each goal/challenge!

I'm about to get into *objects* again and am more than ready!

Will be going through basic webpage structure for JavaScript, HTML and CSS. There's a great tutorial from the MDNS docs that seems more than good enough.

It will help me better understand the structure of all those React/NextJS apps that I've been hammering through.
