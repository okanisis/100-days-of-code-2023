# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 13: January 21, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
#### IPFS
It was all IPFS today. I got inspired by the IPFS intro at LearnWeb3.io.

Once the tutorial was complete I dug deeper and expanded my IPFS locally! I have two laptops running IPFS gateways and the Brave Browser configured to redirect IPFS requests to the local gateway.

There is also the [**IPFS Companion Browser Extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch) which also has a few helpful things to make configuring the browser even easier.

The IPFS gateway was a little bit of work to get setup and working properly. Each device on my LAN is running a IPFS Gateway and are all connected as peers. I can pin items locally, then with a properly configured firewall, use DNSLink to redirect DNS requests to those pinned items!

```sh
% ipfs resolve -r /ipns/indigenis.ca
/ipfs/QmZdoshvZRP8EUupBEw6yr3u1dCWsb2DCYqYpCyiwGRkAd
```

Pretty cool right!!! That's a static test website I deployed with Fleek.xyz (uses IPFS as underlying storage and others) and it's pinned somewhere else but, because I now have it's hash.... I can import it into my local IPFS node or simply redirect my browser to indigenis.ca which will in turn access my LAN IPFS Gateway and cache the above hash locally. Once it's stored locally, I could always pin it and redirect the DNSLink and DNS records to it here.

#### IPFS Network Usage
IPFS will fork out and create as many connections as it can when it starts. If you're on a home router like me at the moment, this is a problem as it can overload the router and in worst cases, take it down!

Use the **`swarm`** and **`ResourceMgr`** sections of the [**IPFS config**](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmresourcemgr) to give IPFS some sane defaults, for example:

```js
"Swarm": {
    "AddrFilters": null,
    "ConnMgr": {
      "GracePeriod": "60s",
      "HighWater": 400,
      "LowWater": 100,
      "Type": "basic"
    },
    "DisableBandwidthMetrics": false,
    "DisableNatPortMap": false,
    "RelayClient": {},
    "RelayService": {},
    "ResourceMgr": {
      "Limits": {
        "System": {
          "Conns": 200,
          "ConnsInbound": 100,
          "ConnsOutbound": 100,
          "Streams": 200,
          "StreamsInbound": 100,
          "StreamsOutbound": 100
        }
      }
    },
```

#### IPFS Others
Eagerly eyeing up [**IPFS Cluster**](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster) which helps orchestrate multiple IPFS Daemons/Gateways and sync pinned items, etc. IPFS Daemons can of course be physically in different locations - a true cluster!

[**IPFS Sync**](https://github.com/TheDiscordian/ipfs-sync) looks like a very useful Daemon which is described as:
> A simple daemon which will watch files on your filesystem, mirror them to MFS, automatically update related pins, and update related IPNS keys.

Perfect!

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
~~consider~~ Contribute~~ing~~ to the [**IPFS Sync**](https://github.com/TheDiscordian/ipfs-sync) project.

My experience with Arch Linux, packange maintenance and building would be an asset as I can see they could have a more robust [**PKGBUILD**](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=ipfs-sync).
