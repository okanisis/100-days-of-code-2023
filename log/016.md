# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 16: January 24, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### JavaScript Review
I went through **Alchemy University** JavaScript Fundamentals/Basics course. Figured a review was in order as I prepare for **Ethereum Bootcamp** which I plan on starting very soon!

#### Gnosis Safe
Most of the day was spent with **Gnosis Safe** as I explored the possibilities of this platform. Multi-sig wallets are secure and capable systems but take careful planning to execute efficiently.

Batch transfers are a nice feature of the webapp but to be really flexible in a group setting it helps to be integrated with other smart contracts to automate arrangements and transfers.

#### reth: an *ethereum node in Rust*
I built a package for [**reth**](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) by [**Paradigm**](https://www.paradigm.xyz/) which is described as:
> *a new Ethereum full-node implementation focused on being user-friendly, modular, fast, and efficient*

#### React: *Part 3 with StackUp.dev*
Continuing the campaign on **React** with **StackUp** is a great primer on **React**.

Part 3 of 4 has us using **React Router** and **Firebase** to launch a blog! This is a work-in-progress and share the final site tomorrow!
