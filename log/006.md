# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

 ## 🗓️ Day 6: January 14, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**
Whoa! So today I deployed a website on fleek.xyz finally and it [reads any pushes to a github repo](https://github.com/okanisis/random-planet-facts) for auto re-deployment! Fleek is so easy to use and beautiful.

It was so easy and I had a small hiccup trying to setup the dns records for a custom google domain I have for testing but after reading the fine print I finally got it all to work and it loads up at [indigenis.ca](https://indigenis.ca)

This is going to be a place holder for a web3 portfolio which led me to find a [web3 portfolio template on github](https://github.com/pointer-gg/web3-portfolio-site) which in turn led me to a new web3 education site - everyone meet: [Pointer](https://pointer.gg)

My avalanche node also finally finished syncing! It's the sync state one I mentioned yesterday and it's reporting `healthy` and processed by first 2 blocks for p-chain!

My first p-chain blocks:

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**
Consider using a [static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/static-site-generators/) - I went through the basic tutorials for them and they are really fun and easy. [Jekyll Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) and [Hugo Tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

### **🗒️ Side-note**
Consider setting up a redirect for my [unstoppabledomains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/?ref=b890a8db99b546b) and [.ens](https://app.ens.domains/) domain to my new fleek portfolio site. Wait for gas fees to come down so can sign transaction for my ENS .eth domain!
