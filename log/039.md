### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

### **Circle Group Buy Smart Contract**

Completed the latest campaign from StackUp!

The Circle API and Smart Contract one. Today was insane! Gas was through the roof and barely made it through.

It cost 0.98 Goerli ETH just to deploy the smart contract, not including authorizing allowances, transfers and other shenanigans.

I'm down to about 1.2 Goerli ETH from about 9.6... This quest was brutal and challenged my convictions in crypto.

It's late, i'm tired and that quest was actually really stressful.

Good night!
