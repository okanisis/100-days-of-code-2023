# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 23: January 31, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

#### **React with StackUp**

I started with continuing my react blog campaign from stackup. Keeping it short. It's not doing what I want it to and will have to come back to it with fresh eyes. So I moved on.

#### **Web3SecurityDAO**

This is where the day got interesting when I discovered a small but very active group called [**Web3SecurityDao**](https://twitter.com/Web3SecurityDAO). I can't remember how I stumbled across them but the [**the Web3SecurityDAO discord**](https://discord.com/invite/DtqrhkTjr8) was full of activity!

They have a great [**collection of resources to get started learning all there is about web3 security**](https://www.web3securitydao.xyz/collaborating/resources). I'll be pouring over in more detail very soon but for now I've started with signing up for their study session and the topic is [**Secureum**](https://secureum.substack.com/about) and I'll be getting up extra early to prep for the [**Genesis Study Group**](https://www.web3securitydao.xyz/collaborating/weekly-study-group/genesis-study-group-02-01-23#what-to-do)

### **😶‍🌫 Thoughts:**

Time to also prep for Radicly.xyz presentation in two weeks! Excited for this and will share more as the date nears.
