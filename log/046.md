### **Web3 Business Development**

### **dApp with StackUp**

Began a new campaign from StackUp on creating a smart contract with a dApp that replicates a quest feature.

Quests can be launched, players can join, and win rewards.

It's explained and laid out in a way that makes it easy to understand. It is by far one of my favourite web3 tutorials to date.
