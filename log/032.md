# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 32: February 09, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

### **JavaScript Arrays**

I passed out last night mid-typing for yesterdays journal so here it is!

I've aligned course tracks with **Alchemy University**, **Exercism**, and **LearnJavaScript.Online**.

Days are definitely a lot faster but pacing through material is having it's benefits.

The challenges at **Exercism** are really fun, but the lesson material isn't that comprehensive. They reference a lot of the MDNS docs which aren't for everyone - but very important so don't underestimate them.

So it's good to also use **Alchemy University** and LearnJavaScript.Online for their explanations and challenges. It's interesting to see everyone's different approach to teaching the same material and it's teaching me a lot.

I'm having a blast using the **exercism cli** and **vscode** to do everything in one place!

### **Canto Validator**

The archive node, which will be used for sentries is at block height **2,361,225** and at height **2,669,495** upgrade to **version 5**!

When that happens, It's perfect timing to start setting up the actual servers. I'll start my **blog** series at this point. Detailing a *basic* setup in **Arch Linux**.

So close to going online - super excited to deploy and start building on **Canto**.
