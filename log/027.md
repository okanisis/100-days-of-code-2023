### **ü•µ Today's Progress**

#### **JavaScript Operators and Exercism**

***

Taking my sweet @#$ time going through [**JavaScript Track at Exercism**](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)

- [**Annalyn's Infiltration**](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/annalyns-infiltration).

With only a single test left to pass, I'm hitting the books. It feels like I've plateau'd and gotta sit back, take a break - come back to it tomorrow.

```shell
% npm run test --workspace=javascript/exercises/concept/annalyns-infiltration

> test
> jest ./*

I'll be tearing into the following which are key to solving this simple challenge:

- [**Logical Operators**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators)
- [**Operator Precedence**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)
  - [**Short-Circuiting**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#short-circuiting)

#### **Canto Node Update**

***

The node is syncing and at block height **1,624,545** running my self compiled cantod binary **v4.0.1**

I got x2 2TB m.2 NVMe for storage to help with the full archive sentry node and coming validator.

Considering throwing up a temporary validator and state-sync/bootstrapped sentry node(s) given the timeframe for completing a full archive node sync.

I'm still at least 2 days out and want to get this all online so bad but let's do this right.

#### **Radicle.xyz Dev-Weekly w/ Alchemy University**

***

I volunteered to give a presentation to the **Developer Guild at Alchemy University** showing [**Radicle.xyz**](https://radicle.xyz/get-started.html) which is a github decentralized alternative for code hosting/collaboration.

It's really cool and I'll be using the **knowledge share session** to push a bunch of code out! That's all I'm gonna say and presentation will be within the next two weeks!

*If there's enough interest and/or time, we will explore hosting and sharing your code from your own node too. This supports private and public hosting of a repository.*

#### **IPFS**

***

I run IPFS on all my systems. Some of them have pinned data that's used for website hosting or just as a gateway for Brave Browser.

I'll be exploring how to deploy a cluster as I want to know the limits and capabilities of coordinated file sharing and hosting on p2p protocols that IPFS use.

#### **Blog?**

***

I want to start blogging about all the projects and things I'm working on.

Currently deciding between:

- [**Mirror.xyz**](https://mirror.xyz/)
- [**DiamondApp**](https://diamondapp.com/)
- [**Hashnode**](https://hashnode.com/)
- *self built & hosted (ie, IPFS)*

### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**

***

It's time to [**learn the debugger in VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) or just how to debug in general.

These simple exercises with the specific tests can be great for learning and applying the debugging process while also seeing the logic. It will take JavaScript beyond `console.log("where did I go wrong?")`
