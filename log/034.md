### **ü•µ Today's Progress**

### **DevTools with StackUp**

[**StackUp has some *off the beaten path* pathways that are tailored for more general introduction type concepts**](https://app.stackup.dev/learn):

- Web3 Development
- Developer Tools
- Web Development

As they fit into my current track, I'll take them on.

The [**StackUp Developer Tools learning pathway**](https://app.stackup.dev/pathway/developer-tools) is overdue as it covers 2 primary skills:

- **Command Line Interfaces**
- **Version Control with Git and Github**

I challenged the **Command Line Interfaces** sub-pathway cause I'm more than comfortable with the concepts. I still browsed the material quickly to ensure nothing really stood out and it seemed really straight forward.

I'm taking on the **Version Control with Git and Github** next!

### **JavaScript**

Continuing with my synchronized learning tracks for **JavaScipt** I learned something new from **Exercism.**

The concept **Increment/Decrement** was super simple and I continued into [**For Loop**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) which I thought I had the grasp of cause all the other tracks covered it.

But, they introduced the following which I took the time to read in the MDNS docs:

- nested for loops
- [`break`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break), [`continue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue) and [`labels`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label)

I've seen `continue` and `break` before but the way it's explained here was more helpful. Recommend checking out **Exercism.io**
