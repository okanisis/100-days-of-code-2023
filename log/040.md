# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 40: February 17, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**

***

### **Git with Alchemy University**

Had a great presentation on Git Basics with Naruto11 from **Alchemy University**.

It inspired me to actually go back and do some serious housecleaning on a repo I've been puting together.

It's a collection of Arch Linux packages related to web3. Notably the nodes I've been deploying and few other goodies.

This repo will be used as an example to deploy to **Radicle.xyz** network. Doing a *knowledge share* next Wednesday 09:00 CST, Feb 22, 2023 in their Discord.

But anyways, I cleaned up that package repo and the `git log` is more linear making use of `rebase` and always "branch early and branch often". It's made the code far more manageable. Who would of thought.

```plaintext
* dd7227d (HEAD -> staging, master) exercism: added glibc dep and shell completions
* 6d88987 uplink: switch to new storj repo
* 9a6a4bd uplink: initial commit
* 9058321 exercism: initial commit
* dcae6d5 canto: upstream fixed v1.0.0 build
* 9fc847a canto: usb support integrated
```

Can't wait to share this with everyone!

### **Season 2 Mentee - DeveloperDAO**

I enrolled to be a **mentee** in **Developer_DAO's Season 2**.

It's a great opportunity to be paired with a possible mentor and learn from a pro! Finally a chance to put my skills and ideas to the test!

So this involves a lot of prep for Monday. It's my chance to meet possible mentors and express (very quickly!!!) who I am and what my idea or project is.

Some of the day was spent forming notes and a way to setup my pitch. I gotta be efficient with my time as it's a small window of opportunity to leave an impression that I am worth mentoring!

### **Canto Node at 96.93%**

The full archive node is almost fully sync'd so I've been working diligently to get the rest of the network prepped and primed for it.

I'll be geographically distributing the nodes as well. Canada - say hello to **Canto!**

Today was getting the final machine setup with a vanilla Arch Linux install.

Been using Git to help manage configs and make the machines easy to manage. Git is awesome!!!
