### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### React with [stackup.dev]
I'm following a new campaign at stackup for React. This is a great lesson on the basics of react but builds it from the ground up. Between two ways to build **React Components** either via **Class-based** or **Functional based**. We start with learning how to do them **Functional**.

```js
// This is how a class based component will look like
import React from "react";
 
class App extends React.Component {
 render() {
  return <h1>My React App</h1>;
 }
}
 
export default App;

// This is how the the same component can be written in functions
import React from ‚Äúreact‚Äù;

function App (){
 return <h1>My React App</h1>;
}
```

Resources like images, videos, etc that will be made **public** go in to, you guessed it, the **public** folder. Most coding starts in the **src** folder and in the **App.js** file which has a boiler plater like this:

```js
import <file name>
import {<components>} from <location of components>
 
function <Function Name>{
   <More JavaScript Code>
 
   return(
      <JSX>
   )
}
 
export default <Function Name>
```

**React** uses **States** to update specfic parts of the webpage and can be accessed using a hook called `useState()` which is essentially a JavaScript function and can be called like:
```js
const [state,setState] = useState();
```
In the example above, `state` is the variable.
`setState` is a function in camelCase that will be used to change it.
The intial value to be used can be placed inside the `()` for `useState()` like `useState(1)`

The `const` must come before the `return` statement to be initialized properly in the **App.js** file.

The tutorial then led into building and deploying on **firebase**. An easy way to install firebase is with **npm** and can be done globally with `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`

Once all code changes are complete we built the project with `npm run build` and copied the contents of the `build/` folder into an empty `public/` folder.

Now it's ready for firebase with `firebase login` followed by `firebase init` which  asks a series of questions mostly which are default answers besides a project name. Then finally `firebase deploy` which returns a url for the project where mine resides at https://okanisis-counterapp.web.app/

#### Create NFT Collection with metadata stored on IPFS
#### with LearnWeb3.io

This project involved utilizing a pinning service called **Pinata** to upload NFT content (*images*) and metadata in the form of JSON that references the pinned content.

The contracts being used are [**Ownable.sol from OpenZeppelin**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) and an [**extension of ERC721 known as ERC721 Enumerable**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol) - very creative.

The contracts compiled and deployed with **hardhat** where the **react/next** website is deployed on **vercel** via **github**!
