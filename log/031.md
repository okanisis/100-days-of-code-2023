# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 31: February 08, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

#### **Web3SecurityDAO Study Session**

Today the afternoon kicked off with the second official study session for Web3SecurityDAO.

Working through Secureum we're on topic two which is Solidity and we had started on Ethereum/Virtual Machines.

They are very technical but deal with the topics on a level I'm really enjoying. Talking about bits and bytes, data types and logic.

It's giving me some great insights into the inner workings of ethereum, solidity and smart contracts.

#### **Dune Analytics**

SQL and Web3!? [**Dune**](https://dune.com/) offers you a way to visualize blockchain using a language that many are already familiar with - SQL!

I played around with it a bit today and play to build some dashboards. All I can say, it that I'm impressed and plan on venturing further into this and GraphQL in the nearby future.
