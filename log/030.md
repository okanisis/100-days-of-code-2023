# 👨‍💻 100 Days Of Code - 🪵 Log

## 🗓️ Day 30: February 07, 2023

### **🥵 Today's Progress**

***

#### **Radicle.xyz Knowledge Share**

I'm prepping for a small 30-60 minute knowledge share with Alchemy University in the Developer Group.

It's coming soon and can't wait to share more and super excited to share with everyone!

Decentralized GitHub ftw!

***

#### **Canto Node Update**

The full archive node is spinning up! We are at block height 2,067,811 which is close to the tip!

Once full node is done, will deploy entire network and document the setup.

***

#### **Blog?**

With how much I've been doing in the web3 space lately and how I see things progressing it's time to start sharing in-detail.

Looking at Mirror.xyz, Hashnode and DiamondApp to distribute my writings.

Launching very soon!
