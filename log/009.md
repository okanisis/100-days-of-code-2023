# üë®‚Äçüíª 100 Days Of Code - ü™µ Log

## üóìÔ∏è Day 9: January 17, 2023

### **ü•µ Today's Progress**
#### **Portrait.gg and Radicle.xyz:**
Started a web3 profile at beta.portrait.gg (have 2 invite codes to share!).

Registered with radicle.xyz - a blockchain alternative to github. The transition is very easy it seems from radicle > github and was able to register it with my ENS domain.

#### **Build Your Own DeX Like Uniswap:**
I graduated from Sophomore track at LearnWeb3.io - the best track I've had there so far!

The DeX comes with two swap functions:
 - `GoerliETH` <-> `Crypto Devs`
 - `GoerliETH` + `Crypto Devs` <=> `Crypto Devs LP Token`

#### **Details:**
 - [**`Crypto Devs` DeX Site**](https://lw3-dex-tutorial-okanisis.vercel.app/)
 - **Contract:** 0x37Fb0E3Eb886A5a3159106832C4656CadE39D0fC
 - **Network:** Ethereum Goerli Testnet
 - [**Etherscan**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x37Fb0E3Eb886A5a3159106832C4656CadE39D0fC)

### **üò∂‚Äçüå´ Thoughts:**
Time to deep dive into radicle, setup my own `seed`/`node` and get serious!

Where do I find a +4TB SSD!?

It's time to develop a concrete learning and education plan. Alchemy University and LearnWeb3.io have been really great, but I'm considering a hardcore bootcamp like approach to this and after taking the basics can now formulate a plan of attack!
