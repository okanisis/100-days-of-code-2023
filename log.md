Focusing on Alchemy University JavaScript and Ethereum Bootcamp. Working towards Avalanche!

## Day 1: January 09, 2023

### **Today's Progress**
Have made prior progress in Alchemy University JavaScript's **The Basics**. Today was a little different though as I ran into something a little more advanced.

Topics covered included: `this`, `bind` (`implicit binding` with `call-site`), and **Unbound** (aka, fixing the context of functions using: `closure`, `binding functions` and `arrow syntax`).

It's essentially about how an `obj` is referenced using `this` `globally` vs `locally`as they are inside and outside of `functions()`. Note to self `arrow syntax` is really nice and this topic is something to really dig into and come back to until it is clearly understood. 

How `this` is [explained at w3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp) is great with `bind`, `call`, and `apply` examples.

The way it was presented in AU was not very intro friendly imo so spent many hours reading the MDNS docs and asking ChatGPT to learn those references then create small challenges for me. ChatGPT was also helpful by breaking down some of the technical descriptions with real world examples and in simple terms to help absorb the material.

Explored other possible decentralized web3 hosting solutions. These include IPFS which has some limitations (ie, gateways going down that are not pinned, or the pinned service going down itself!) and then found [fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz) which is built on the fleek network. Then there is [Portrait.gg](https://join.portrait.gg) built on top of arweave but is in closed beta atm.

The idea of hosting the entire codebase of your dApp on-chain and in true web3-style is exciting!

### **Thoughts:**
Ethereum Bootcamp is already underway and that class is around the week 6 mark. I don't know how I feel about being rushed but trying to understand this intro material as best as possible.

The pace up to today was very nice but the content covered was a little more than expected and disrupted the pace more than I was comfortable with. Normally I would of struggled and spent countless hours on Google but ChatGPT was there and available to discuss the topics I was covering in specific and detail at a level that I could understand.

I do have some background experience using javascript, sql, python, bash/zsh from my GIS days which is no-doubt helping.

Continue to take notes in Joplin and sync them securely to storj.io!

Continue with the advanced tracks at LearnWeb3DAO!

For further practice, help out at the JavaScript Basics discord threads in the AU Discord.

Checkout codewars for additional practice and challenges.

### *Side-note:**
ava-labs/subnet-cli v0.0.4 was released today! Nothing exciting but glad to see progress made on Avalanche as one day will deploy my projects over der.
